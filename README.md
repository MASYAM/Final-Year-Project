Project Objectives:

Based on gamification concept, our goal was to make first social simulation game in Bangladesh with
the purpose of creating creative and positive young generation to take contribution in social
development. Specially, with the purpose of entertainment this game will shape such mind set of a
player, so that they can be more social, creative and positive to understand behavior of socialization.


Overview:

Game industries have entered a phase of quick advancement. Different types of games are coming
regular on play stores. Now a day, people spend too much time in front of devices like computers and
mobiles. So, it is a smarter approach to reach people through technology. The project we have
developed is a game specially for PC, Android and IOS platform. We have used our game as a learning
tool.
This is basically a gamification of health-care suggestions specially for pregnant women. Furthermore,
it is similar to popular games like Farmville, Hay Day and so on, but it has different stimuli with
different objectives and game play. Its gameplay involves various aspects of home management such
as building and decorating home and caring family (parental care), ploughing land, planting, growing,
and harvesting crops, harvesting trees and raising livestock, and competing others in mini social game
events. It has also several govt. helps centres (Like Hospital, Agriculture, Female Education etc.) which
are added to help managing gameplay as well as to provide information where they can get support in
real life.
We have proposed the design and implementation of the game. We have designed and developed
different stages according to the learning curve carefully. We collected necessary data from
government offices in order to make the gameplay of taking care of pregnant women. All the game
assets have created using Adobe Photoshop and 3ds Max. We developed the game successfully in
Unity3D game engine by utilizing C# programming language within 6 months (Jun, 2017-Nov, 2017)
period of given time by the University.
